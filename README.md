POST /api/polls
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Favorite Programming Language",
  "options": ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java", "C++"]
}
```

### Get All Polls

```http
GET /api/polls
```

### Vote on a Poll

```http
POST /api/polls/:pollId/vote
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "option": "JavaScript"

```

## API Endpoints

Hereâ€™s a list of the main API endpoints available:

| Method | Endpoint                          | Description                          |
|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/polls`                     | Retrieve all polls                   |
| POST   | `/api/polls`                     | Create a new poll                    |
| GET    | `/api/polls/:pollId`             | Retrieve a specific poll             |
| POST   | `/api/polls/:pollId/vote`        | Vote on a specific poll              |
| DELETE | `/api/polls/:pollId`             | Delete a specific poll               |

## Real-time Voting Updates

One of the key features of the Challenge API is real-time voting updates. By using WebSockets, the API allows clients to receive updates as votes are cast. 

### How It Works

1. When a user votes, the server updates the poll data.
2. The server then broadcasts the updated poll data to all connected clients.
3. Clients can listen for these updates and refresh their UI accordingly.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to connect to the WebSocket server:

```javascript
const socket = io('http://localhost:3000');

socket.on('pollUpdated', (poll) => {
  console.log('Poll updated:', poll);
  // Update the UI with the new poll data
});
```

## Testing

To ensure the API works as expected, you can run tests using the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Make sure to have a test database set up in your environment variables.
